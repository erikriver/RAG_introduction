      "A classic question!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Light from the sun**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it contains all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n",
      "2. **Molecules in the air**: The atmosphere is made up of tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n",
      "3. **Scattering**: When sunlight hits these small molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blue light dominates**: Because the scattering effect is more significant for blue light, more of this shorter-wavelength light is scattered towards our eyes. This is why the sky appears blue to us!\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Red light continues unscattered**: The longer wavelengths of light, like red and orange, are not scattered as much. They continue traveling in a straight line, reaching our eyes without being deflected.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Atmospheric conditions**: Factors like dust, water vapor, and pollutants can also affect the color of the sky by scattering or absorbing certain wavelengths of light. This is why the sky may appear more hazy or gray on cloudy days.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sky appears blue because shorter-wavelength blue light is scattered more than other colors by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere, while longer-wavelength red light continues to travel in a straight line to our eyes.\n"

      "2. **Migraines**: These are a type of vascular headache characterized by throbbing pain, often accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound. If you experience flashing lights, blind spots, or other visual disturbances along with the headache, migraines might be the culprit.\n",
      "3. **Sinusitis**: Inflammation in the sinuses can cause headaches, especially if you have a cold, allergies, or a deviated septum. Are your sinuses feeling congested?\n",
      "4. **Infection**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections like meningitis, encephalitis, or sinusitis can cause severe headache pain.\n",
      "5. **Substance withdrawal**: If you're trying to quit smoking or drinking, withdrawal symptoms can include headaches.\n",
      "6. **Hormonal fluctuations**: Women may experience headaches related to hormonal changes during their menstrual cycles, menopause, or pregnancy.\n",
      "7. **Sleep disorders**: Insomnia, sleep apnea, or restless leg syndrome can cause morning headaches.\n",
      "8. **Medication side effects**: Certain medications, such as painkillers, blood pressure medications, or antidepressants, can cause headaches as a side effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for treatment, it depends on the underlying cause of your headache. In general:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) might help.\n",
      "* Prescription medications like triptans (e.g., Imitrex) can be effective for migraines.\n",
      "* Antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal sprays may help with sinusitis.\n",
      "* Antibiotics are necessary if an infection is causing your headache.\n",
